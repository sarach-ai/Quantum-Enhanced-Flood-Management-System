# Quantum-Enhanced-Flood-Management-System
This is a project proposed by me and my team at the "First Quantum Computing Hackathon of Pakistan 2026" consisting of three integrated parts. In part 1, flood prediction is done for different areas using QSVC on feature data. In part 2, evacuation shelter placement is optimized using QAOA. Then at last, flood mapping is done using Hybrid CNNs.
